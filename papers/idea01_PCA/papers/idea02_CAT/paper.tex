\begin{abstract}
This short paper outlines the idea of Causal Audit Trails (CAT) for tracking the provenance of each token generated by large language models. CAT constructs a directed acyclic graph that records how sources, tools, and prompts influence claims, enabling auditability and trust in high-stakes domains.
\end{abstract}

\section{Overview}
We motivate the need for provenance and traceability in AI outputs and describe how a causal DAG can be recorded during inference.

\section{Implementation}
Our implementation is provided in \texttt{code.py} and demonstrates how to collect and display a simple causal audit trail using the \texttt{sciresearch\_ai} package.
