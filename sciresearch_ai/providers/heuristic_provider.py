"""
HeuristicProvider: a lightweight offline provider that generates
semi‑structured research content without requiring access to external
models or APIs.  This provider is designed to return plausible
scientific prose based solely on the input prompt using a handful of
heuristics and templates.  It enables high quality draft papers in
environments where network access is unavailable or API keys are
missing.

The heuristics inspect the prompt for keywords associated with the
different stages of the research loop—planning, experiment design,
debate, and revision.  Depending on the detected intent the provider
returns a tailored response.  If no intent is matched a generic
response is produced that paraphrases the question.

The goal of this provider is not to discover novel science, but to
produce coherent LaTeX sections with reasonable content that passes
basic quality gates (grammar, formatting, logical flow).  You can
extend or refine the heuristics to better suit your domain.
